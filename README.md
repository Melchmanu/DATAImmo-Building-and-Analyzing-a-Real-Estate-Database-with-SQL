# DATAImmo: Building and Analyzing a Real Estate Database with SQL  

![Project Banner](https://github.com/Melchmanu/Portfolio/tree/main/images/Data%20Management.jpg)

## üìã Project Overview  

**DATAImmo** is a strategic project for Laplace Immo, aimed at creating and analyzing a relational database to better predict property prices. This project leverages data from multiple sources (e.g., open data from DVF, INSEE, and Data.gouv) while ensuring GDPR compliance.  

Key outcomes of this project include:  
- A fully normalized (3NF) relational database.  
- Integration of demographic, geographic, and real estate transaction data.  
- Analytical insights to guide regional agencies in advising clients.  

## üóÇÔ∏è Hosted Resources  

### Data Files  
The following datasets were processed and integrated into the database:  
- `Bien.csv`  
- `donnees_communes nettoy√©2.csv`  
- `fr-esr-referentiel-geographique nettoy√©2.csv`  
- `Lieu.csv`  
- `population.csv`  
- `Regiondepcom.csv`  
- `Transactions.csv`  
- `Valeurs-fonci√®res nettoy√©2.csv`  

### Presentation  
The presentation detailing the methodology, results, and key takeaways is hosted [here](https://github.com/Melchmanu/DATAImmo-Building-and-Analyzing-a-Real-Estate-Database-with-SQL/blob/main/Melchiori_Manuel_2_support_presentation_062024.pdf).

## üöÄ Key Features  

1. **Data Dictionary**:  
   Developed a detailed dictionary defining the structure of the integrated datasets, including:  
   - Field descriptions.  
   - Types, lengths, and constraints.  
   - Management and calculation rules.  

2. **Relational Schema (3NF)**:  
   - Updated and normalized relational schema to support seamless data storage and analysis.  
   - Implemented primary and foreign keys to define relationships between entities.  

3. **Database Creation**:  
   - Designed and implemented the database in SQL, ensuring compatibility with CSV imports.  
   - Built tables based on the normalized schema, with careful attention to data types and constraints.  

4. **Compliance with GDPR**:  
   - Anonymized sensitive data to protect user privacy.  
   - Ensured all operations align with data protection standards.

## üìä Tools & Technologies  

- **SQL**: Used for database design, table creation, and querying.  
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and analysis.  
- **Draw.io / SQL Power Architect**: To create and update the relational schema.  
- **CSV Files**: For data import/export between sources and the database.  
- **GDPR Compliance**: Followed best practices for data protection.  

## üìà Key Deliverables  

1. **Normalized Relational Database**  
   - Operational database with defined primary and foreign keys.  
   - Tables aligned with the normalized schema (3NF).  

2. **Presentation**  
   - Detailed explanation of the schema, data integration process, and analytical insights.  

3. **Data-Driven Insights**  
   - Analysis of market trends to support better client recommendations.
